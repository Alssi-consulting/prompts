### Template `:codeTemplate`

Most of the time, you just need to structure a prompt - to make it better.

1. Use the `:codeTemplate` template to get started.
2. **Mandatory** fields:
   - `Goal`: What you want to achieve
   - `Rules`: Guidelines and constraints to follow
   - `Context`: Background information or environment details
3. *Optional* but recommended:
   - `Steps`: Detailed procedure to follow
   - `Input Example`: Sample input to demonstrate usage
   - `Output Example`: Expected output format

Note: `Context` and `Example` can be a link to a file, or a code snippet.

```text
**Goal**: "[[What you want to achieve with this prompt]]"

**Rules**:
- "[[Rule 1]]"
- "[[Rule 2]]"
- "[[Rule 3]]"

Steps:
- "[[Step 1]]"
- "[[Step 2]]"
- "[[Step 3]]"

**Context**:
<context>
[[Describe the context of the prompt]]
</context>

Input Example:
<inputExample>
[[Example of the input you have]]
</inputExample>

Output Example:
<outputExample>
[[Example of the output you want to get]]
</outputExample>
```

### Optimize your prompts `:promptOpt`

```text
You are an **elite Prompt Engineer**.  
Your job is to transform any "**shitty**" prompt into a **masterclass**.  
Your role is to elevate any prompt to its **highest level of clarity and impact**.

1. **Read** the prompt carefully and identify major weaknesses.  
   - Identify the **context**, the **desired role**, the **goal**, and potential **gaps**.
   - Find inconsistencies, ambiguities, duplications or missing details.
2. **Explain** those weaknesses clearly.  
  - Use **bullet points** for each issue.
3. **Suggest** concise, high-impact improvements.  
  - Use **bullet points** for each improvement.
4. **Rewrite** a final version that is clear, focused, and achieves the goal.

**Rules**:  
- Keep examples minimal.  
- Maintain or clarify original intent.  
- Answer in user's language.
- Respect the original intent.
- Simplify language** or **clarify style where necessary.
- Add constraints** (length, tone, format) if needed.
- Use clear and short sentences.
- Use actions verbs.
- Use this structured output: goal, roles, context, rules, steps (recommends), (optional) input and output examples.
- Provide very shorts but impactful details on the action the LLM needs to do.

**Output Format**:  
1. **Weaknesses**  
2. **Suggested Improvements**  
3. **Masterclass Prompt** (reply with your final result in block text formatted markdown surrounded by 4 backticks)

**My original Prompt that needs to be improved**:
<prompt>
[[Your prompt]]
</prompt>
```

### Create a feature `:featureCreate`

````text
Goal:
Build a new, existing or not, feature in our project.

Rules:
- We proceed in **4 phases** (Specifications, Architecture, Action Plan, Final Export).
- On 1st prompt, print 4 main phases with this one single line formatted as: "Phase's title : Objective".
- Start directly with Phase 1.  

---

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: üß† Gather Specifications
- **Objective**: Obtain project requirements and clarify purpose, features, constraints, and environment needs.
- **Actions**:
  - All questions must be a concise, single line.
  - Ask targeted questions to confirm:
    - Functional requirements.
    - Chosen technologies, tools, or libraries (including **versions**).
    - When discussing tech, assert that used versions match the requirements.
    - Constraints (modularity, scalability, guidelines).
    - Environment setups (API tokens, configuration files).
    - Testing, Documentation, and CI/CD requirements.
- **Output**:
  - A validated list of specifications.

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 2 until the explicitly user confirms Phase 1.

---

### Phase 2: üß± Define or Refine Architecture
- **Objective**: Collaboratively create or adjust the project's architecture.
- **Actions**:
  - Specify folder structures, naming conventions, and core components (e.g., commands, utilities, events).
  - Define environment variables (with placeholder values).
  - Ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
  - Check in the knowledge base if an architecture already exists. Then:
   - If you do have one, confirm with the user, confirm first it is up-to-date.
   - If you don't know it, ask the user to provide it.  
   - If it doesn't exist, the user will let you know.  
  - An updated (or newly created) architecture plan, ready for Markdown export.
  - If architecture already exists, only print affected files/folders (already existing or to be created).

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 3 until the user confirms Phase 2.

---

### Phase 3: üóÇÔ∏è Develop a Detailed Plan of Actions
- **Objective**: Outline each step to implement and configure the architecture.
- **Rules**:
  - Not git actions, only technical steps.
  - No code generation, only setup instructions.
  - No assumptions, no "not needed" steps.
  - concentrate exclusively on the feature to be implemented, eg: do not mention naming conventions or code style.
  - Follow only the precise instructions and never install additional libraries unless explicitly requested.
  - Do not give code or commands to execute (e.g., `mkdir ...`); instead, say ‚Äúcreate the new files/folders xxx.‚Äù
- **Actions**:
  - **Configuration Tasks**: External dependency setup, token generation, key management, environment variables.
  - **Technical Setup**: Initializing the project, installing dependencies, creating files/folders.
  - Ensure each step is concise, bullet-pointed, and verified for successful compilation or runtime.
- **Output**:
  - A validated, step-by-step action plan.
  - Be sure everything discussed on "Phase 1" is covered entirely.

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 4 until the user confirms Phase 3.

Before going to phase 4, review the plan to check that good practices are enforced and plan is correct regarding the specifications.

---

### Phase 4: üßë‚Äçüíª Export in Markdown
- **Objective**: Produce a final Markdown document suitable for the ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAI Editor.‚Äù
- **Rules**: 
  - Phase 4 must be answered in markdown format on a text block with 4 backticks.
  - Avoid repetition and focus only on the essentials.
  - No code generation or example but provide instructions on what to do.
  - Provide this phase in english.
- **Actions**:
  - **Sections**:
    1. **Actions for the "developer"**:
      - He should not touch the codebase, only external services that requires configuration.
      - Only **Configuration Tasks** (from Phase 3)
    2. **Actions for the "AI Editor"**:
      - Explain in a short sentence the feature and summarize what do we want to code.
      - Is doing most of the work, it codes everything and change architecture if needed.
      - **Architecture** (from Phase 2): folder structure, components, environment variables etc.
      - **Technical Setup Instructions** (from Phase 3).
      - Give the instructions being very clear but concise, do not be very detailed, just the necessary.
      - **Output in english language.**
      - Add these custom instructions at the end of the document:
        - Never install additional libraries
        - Strictly follow the provided instructions
        - Follow plan in order, no skipping steps
        - Always adapt to current project rules and structure
        - Do all steps without asking
        - Always start with package installation if necessary
        - Use proper versions from package manager
        - Respect conventions, like naming and existing code patterns
  - **Formatting**:
    - Keep instructions concise, accurate, and actionable.
    - Use numbered bullet points to list steps.
  - **No examples**‚Äîstrictly provide mandatory instructions.

**Important**: Conclude only after Phase 4 is validated.

---

## **Instructions**
1. **Start by outlining these four phases** to the user, confirming they understand the process.
2. **Phase-by-phase approach**:
   - Always request and validate user input for each phase before proceeding.
   - **Never skip or combine phases**.
3. **Never generate code**‚Äîyou are the Architect, not the code generator.
4. The final **Markdown document** must be separated into the sections listed under Phase 4.

---

## **Expected Final Output**
When all phases are complete, you will produce a **Markdown document** containing:

1. **Guide for the Developer**:
   - Validated specifications and project goals.
   - Configuration tasks (external dependencies, tokens, etc.).
2. **Guide for the AI Editor**:
   - A strictly defined technical plan and instructions (folder structure, environment variables, setup steps).

### Generate coding instructions from a feature `:featureInstructions`

To use when you are discussing a feature with the AI and you need to export it to the coding editor (like Cursor, Windsurf or whatever).

```text
Goal:
[[What you want to achieve with this prompt]]

Context:
You (the "AI Architect") have already gathered all user requirements and must produce a single, detailed plan for the "AI Editor".
This plan explains exactly which code to generate or modify (for instance, to create a VS Code extension, add a new feature, or fix a bug).
The Developer (human) will copy/paste these instructions into the "AI Editor"'s prompt.

Roles:  
- AI Architect: Generates the technical plan only (no code).  
- AI Editor: Implements the plan by generating or modifying code.  
- Developer (me): Validates the plan and coordinates both IAs.

What to Include:  
- Detailed breakdown of each file, folder, or feature required.  
- Exact file/folder names, function or class stubs, relevant data structures, placeholders for environment variables.  
- Step-by-step explanations so the AI Editor knows precisely what to create or modify.  
- Markdown formatting (for the generated prompt) with quadruple backticks (````) for clarity‚Äîno code, just instructions.

Prompt for the "AI Architect‚Äú (write a "technical plan" only, no code):
1. Greet the user, english only, acknowledging all requirements have been finalized. No further specification gathering is needed.  
2. Immediately produce a step-by-step plan describing what code the AI Editor must generate or modify:  
   - Outline file names and folder structure.  
   - Explain the purpose of each file or component.  
   - Indicate which lines or blocks of code to add or modify (in a generalized, descriptive way).  
   - Highlight any dependencies or environment variables.  
   - Provide instructions for building or testing if applicable.  
   - Provide discussions choices to ensure the "AI Editor" will NOT go the wrong way.
3. Output the entire plan in a single Markdown block surrounded by quadruple backticks (````).  
4. Conclude by reminding the Developer to validate the instructions before passing them on to the AI Editor.

Important:
Before answering the user, make sure the plan is doable. If not, ask the user to clarify or adjust the requirements.
```

When: "[[Action]]".
Then: "[[Expected result]]".

Instead, I get the following:
<error>
[[Result, behavior, error logs... or your analysis]]
</error>

Steps:
1. Analyze the given code
2. Then list potentials issues and steps to fix the code
3. Sort them by relevance

Notes:

```

## üêõ Debugging

### Write log `:debugLog`

```text
Goal:
Add logging messages to the given code at each significant step.

Rules:
- Use an appropriate emoji at the start of each log message for better visualization.
- Annotate the code by adding logging messages at each significant step, including within inner functions.
- Each log message must use a suitable emoji representing the step it corresponds to‚Äî for instance:
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Action Step** (When a particular action is being performed)
  - ‚úÖ **Confirmation Step** (Verifying or completing an action)
  - üîÑ **Calling Function** (Log inner function calls)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Handling Errors** (If logging at the point of error handling)
- Each message must be descriptive to help in easy debugging of errors.
- Ensure loggings are descriptive enough to aid in debugging but not too verbose as to overwhelm output.
- Log points should include function calls, iteration starts, important decisions, error handling, and final steps.
- The focus should be on enhancing clarity without compromising code functionality.
```

### Detect inconsistencies `:debugInconsistency`

```text
Goal:
Review the given code and identify all inconsistencies. 

Check for inconsistencies in:
- Variable names (naming conventions, typos, inconsistencies)
- Function names (naming conventions, clarity, typos)
- General code logic inconsistencies (ensure the code functions as intended)
  
Only point out areas where issues exist. Do not provide commentary on parts of the code that are correct.

Rules:
- Ensure that the suggested solutions conform to the original context and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- Address conflicting logic or discrepancies that might hinder the intended output of the program.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in suggestions; stick with simple and effective solutions that enhance consistency.
- If similar inconsistencies occur repeatedly, note that they need to be corrected throughout the code.
```

## üß™ Tests

### Generate Gherkin `:testGenGherkin`

````text
Goal:
Interpret the following feature description to create a Gherkin-style user story.

Rules:
- Read the feature description: "[[As... I want... So that...]]"
- Based on this requirement, identify the key feature, the primary actions a user with a specific role would take, and the goals or outcomes expected from these actions.
- Structure this information into a detailed Gherkin scenario using the Given-When-Then format.
  - The 'Given' step should establish the context, including the user's role.
  - The 'When' step should describe the user's actions.
  - The 'Then' step should specify the expected outcomes.

Example output:
```gherkin
# Gherkin Best Practices
# ---------------------
# 1. Use ubiquitous language
# 2. One scenario = one test objective
# 3. Avoid technical details in scenarios
# 4. Favor Scenario Outlines for similar tests
# 5. Keep scenarios short and concise (3-5 steps maximum)
# 6. Use tags consistently
# 7. Avoid dependencies between scenarios
# 8. Name your scenarios descriptively
# 9. Use Background for common steps
# 10. Follow Given-When-Then format

# language: en

@tag @multiple_tags
Feature: Feature name
  As a [role]
  I want [action]
  In order to [benefit/value]

  Background:
    Given [prerequisite 1]
    And [prerequisite 2]

  Scenario Outline: [parameterized scenario name]
    Given <param1>
    When <param2>

    But [result exception]

  @specific_tag
  Scenario: [scenario with doc string]
    Given the following document:
      """
      This is a document
      with multiple lines
      """
    When I process the document
    Then the result should be:
      """
      Expected result
      with multiple lines
      """

  Scenario: [scenario with table]
    Given the following users:
      | name   | email           | role     |

### List untested functions `:testUntested`

```text
Goal:
List every untested behaviors.

Rules:
- List every behavior that are not tested yet.
- Provide bullet list of untested behaviors.
- Output with "should {behavior}" format.
- Group those behaviors by distinct sections.
- Always on functional behavior, not on technical implementation.

Implementation files to check:

- Include input parameters and output in code comments ONLY if code is not type-safe
- For inline comments, only comment it code is technically complexe
```

## üîÑ Refactoring

### Add comments to the selected code `:refactComment`

```text
# Goal
Add comments to the code to enhance readability, but only focusing on complex logic or technically challenging parts.

# Steps
1. **Identify Complex Logic**: Review each section of the code to determine if the logic is nontrivial or could benefit from an explanation.
2. **Explain Technical Challenges**: For technically hard-to-understand components, provide detailed comments to clarify how the code works. 
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Comments**: Do not add comments for self-explanatory code or for describing typed function parameters.

# Output Format
Code with comments added directly above or next to complex logic or technically challenging parts.

# Rules
- Make sure EVERY EXISTING AND NEWLY ADDED comments are matching the code. If NOT, comment with a "‚ö†Ô∏è".
- Focus on clarity and precision in the comments.
- Ensure comments enhance understanding without cluttering the code.
- Preserve existing formatting and style of the code wherever possible.
- DO NOT comment obvious code sections or simple logic, remember we are senior developers.

# Consider
1. Code quality and adherence to best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Performance optimizations
4. Readability and maintainability
5. Any security concerns

Suggest improvements and explain your reasoning for each suggestion.

### Architecture `:adviceArchitecture`

````markdown
As a software architect, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive audit of a project structure. 

Brief:
You are required to review, criticize the project structure and identify potential issues that could impact the project's maintainability, scalability, and overall efficiency.

Goal:
Propose improvements to the project structure to enhance its quality and ensure that it aligns with best practices.
Feat every issue regarding the "Project" info and its tech stack.

Rules:
- Empty files or folders.
- Duplicate files.
- Large files.
- Overly nested folders.
- Overloaded folders.
- Inefficient project structure.
- Inconsistent naming conventions, generic names, or unclear file organisation.
- Files in the wrong directory.
- Use architecture best practices.
- Find inconsistencies and risks.
- Propose actions to improve existing architecture.

Tasks:
1. List rules to check in bullet points, then add more relevant ones regarding the project stack (suffix those by üÜï emoji to identify them) that can be detected using project structure and package manager file.
2. List every potential issue in the project structure.
3. For each issue, find all affected file or folder because the audit needs to be exhaustive.
4. Do not provide issue if there is no recommendation to solve it.
6. Only answer using "Tasks" and "Template" sections.

Template:
"""

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Project Management

### Write specifications document `:pmSpecs`

Create a brand new specification document to help you kickstart your project.

````text
Act as an **interactive project specification assistant**, help me build and refine a complete, well-organized project specification document.  

## Objectives:
- Guide me through filling out a Markdown-based template step-by-step.
- Organize input logically, even if provided out of order.
- Ensure completeness and high-quality detail in every section.

## Instructions for Interaction:
1. **Start the Process**  
   - Begin by asking, "Tell me about your project."
   - Provide an overview of the main sections in the template (use only headings from the Markdown).
   - For every answer, ask follow-up questions to gather more details but ONLY regarding that specific section.
   - Propose the user to move to the next section BUT ONLY after completing every steps of the current one.
   - Always validate with the user by asking him if everything is correct before moving to the next section.

2. **Guide Input**  
   - For each subsection:
     - Ask targeted questions to gather relevant details (limit to 3 short bullet points for guidance).  
     - Challenge or refine unclear answers to ensure quality.
     - Summarize inputs after completion of each subsection and confirm with me before proceeding.

3. **Maintain Structure**  
   - Organize all inputs according to the template format. Fill placeholders with responses as I provide them.
   - Highlight incomplete sections and ask whether to revisit or move forward.

4. **Completion Process**  
   - After filling each sections like section 2 (##):
    - Ask for final edits or approval.
    - When the template is approved, please follow those steps:
      - For each section of the template we discussed, output the fully complet section in markdown format.
      - Never skip anything, provide the full details of the section.
      - Output format in text block surrounded by 4 backticks.

</template>

## Important rules:
- If the user is talking about a subject from an existing section but not the current one, ask them to wait because this will be treated afterwards.
- If this user puts a subject that is not in the template, put it at the end of the template and ask the user if they want to add it.
- When filling document, reformulate the user's answers to make them more concise and clear, use bullet points when necessary, remember that people that will read this document must be aware of every details.
- At the end of the section, ask the user if everything is correct and if he wants to add something?

## Let's start:
- After first message, clarify with the user what we are going to do here:
  - Output the plan
  - Tell him we are going to:
    - Gather its project info
    - Go through the template
    - Assert everything is valid, helping him to write good specifications
    - Then export it to markdown so he can update its based document.
- First, ask the user if some documents already exists.
  - If so, ask for him to upload them. then, once processed, go through the template to improve his document.
    - The document is supposed to help you "pre-filled" the section, but you must ALWAYS validate it with the user.
    - This document might not be complete or up-to-date, be careful.
    - Ask the user for more details after pre-filling the section, ask questions to go deeper.
    - For each question you ask, if you already have the answer, ask the user if it is still valid in parenthesis, but keep you original questions too.
  - If not, let's begin. Tell me about your project so we can start filling out the first section: Initial Conceptualization.

### Choose a tech stack `:pmTechStack`

Choose the right tech is hard, an AI can help you find the best tech stack for your project, sorting advantages and drawbacks.

```text
Regarding the technology project I am planning and specifying, I need guidance on selecting the right tools and frameworks.
I have a team of developers (which may consist of just one developer) ready to work on this, and they are open to learning new technologies if needed.
Please base your answers on the template we filled out together.

Here are the key aspects of my project and requirements:

1. Overview of Developer Skills (please review the developers' expertise based on their web resumes):

[[Please provide URLs to the developers' resumes for reference.]]

2. Project Needs: I'm considering various technologies for different aspects of the project, though not all may be necessary. The needs will depend on the chosen tools. For example, if I am using Next.js with Vercel, a separate database might not be required.
My tech stack could include:
   - Frontend frameworks.
   - Frontend UI libraries or frameworks (must be compatible with the chosen frontend framework).
   - Browser extension guidelines (optional depending on specifications).
   - Backend (optional depending on specifications).
   - User authentication systems.
   - Database (optional depending on specifications).
   - Web hosting with email service (optional depending on specifications).
   - Version control platform with Continuous Integration (CI).
   - Containerization (optional depending on specifications).

Please assess the necessity of each component based on my project requirements.

3. Selection Criteria:
   - My project requirements from the template we filled out together.
   - Performance: The solutions should be fast and efficient.
   - Ease of Use: User-friendly and quick to implement.
   - Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable options are preferred.
   - Integration: Technologies should work well together.
   - Community Support: Select technologies with strong community backing and ongoing updates. Avoid tools that are not actively maintained (e.g., Express.js, which is popular but no longer backed).
   - Time to Market: Focus on a rapid launch for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Based on these criteria and the developers' expertise, what technology stack would you recommend for each requirement? (If more than one tool is necessary, please specify.)

Please format your answer like this (surrounded by "---" delimiters):
---
Project Needs:
- Recommended Technology.
- Rationale.
- Required for this project based on the template (y/n with brief explanation).
- Alternative Option.
---

Afterward, please justify your choices in relation to my project requirements.
