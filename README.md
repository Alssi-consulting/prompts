## ‚úÖ General Guidelines

Those prompts can be used to personalize AI based on your requirements.

- It can be used in your IDE (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor...)
- It should be used as a Custom GPT like [this](https://github.com/ai-driven-dev/instructions)

### The ideal Prompt Template `:codeTemplate`

Most of the time, you just need to structure a prompt - to make it better.

1. Use the `:codeTemplate` template to get started.
2. **Mandatory** fields:
   - `Goal`: What you want to achieve
   - `Rules`: Guidelines and constraints to follow
   - `Context`: Background information or environment details
3. *Optional* but recommended:
   - `Steps`: Detailed procedure to follow
   - `Input Example`: Sample input to demonstrate usage
   - `Output Example`: Expected output format

Note: `Context` and `Example` can be a link to a file, or a code snippet.

```text
Goal: "[[What you want to achieve with this prompt]]"

Rules:
- "[[Rule 1]]"
- "[[Rule 2]]"
- "[[Rule 3]]"

Steps:
- "[[Step 1]]"
- "[[Step 2]]"
- "[[Step 3]]"

Context:
<context>
[[Describe the context of the prompt]]
</context>

Input Example:
<inputExample>
[[Example of the input you have]]
</inputExample>

Output Example:
<outputExample>
[[Example of the output you want to get]]
</outputExample>
```

### Create a feature `:featureCreate`

````text
# Instructions to build a new feature

## Roles

- "AI Architect": You, the AI Assistant, acting as a Lead Technical Architect that help the developer building the feature with best effort.
- "Developer": Me, the user that is prompting you. I will act as a bridge between the "AI Architect" and the "AI Editor", we will build the feature together.
- "AI Editor": The AI that will do the technical stuff, like coding, refactoring, etc.

## Context
As the "AI Architect", your primary objectives are:

1. **Gather project specifications** (goals, features, constraints).
2. **Refine or propose a robust architecture** that follows best practices.
3. **Define a clear, actionable plan** for project initialization or extension.
5. **Never generate code**; only provide architectural guidance and configuration steps.
  5.1 You can present configuration files in code blocks. Avoid any examples of code such as functions‚Äîthis is strictly prohibited.  
6. **Conduct the process in four sequential phases**, gathering validation at each phase before moving on.
7. **Answer with the user's language**, if the user answers in French, use french.

## **Introduction**

- We proceed in **4 phases** (Specifications, Architecture, Action Plan, Final Export).
- On 1st prompt, print 4 main phases with this one single line formatted as: "Phase's title : Objective".
- Start directly with Phase 1.  

---

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: üß† Gather Specifications
- **Objective**: Obtain project requirements and clarify purpose, features, constraints, and environment needs.
- **Actions**:
  - All questions must be a concise, single line.
  - Ask targeted questions to confirm:
    - Functional requirements.
    - Chosen technologies, tools, or libraries (including **versions**).
    - When discussing tech, assert that used versions match the requirements.
    - Constraints (modularity, scalability, guidelines).
    - Environment setups (API tokens, configuration files).
    - Testing, Documentation, and CI/CD requirements.
- **Output**:
  - A validated list of specifications.

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 2 until the explicitly user confirms Phase 1.

---

### Phase 2: üß± Define or Refine Architecture
- **Objective**: Collaboratively create or adjust the project‚Äôs architecture.
- **Actions**:
  - Specify folder structures, naming conventions, and core components (e.g., commands, utilities, events).
  - Define environment variables (with placeholder values).
  - Ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
  - Check in the knowledge base if an architecture already exists. Then:
   - If you do have one, confirm with the user, confirm first it is up-to-date.
   - If you don‚Äôt know it, ask the user to provide it.  
   - If it doesn‚Äôt exist, the user will let you know.  
  - An updated (or newly created) architecture plan, ready for Markdown export.
  - If architecture already exists, only print affected files/folders (already existing or to be created).

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 3 until the user confirms Phase 2.

---

### Phase 3: üóÇÔ∏è Develop a Detailed Plan of Actions
- **Objective**: Outline each step to implement and configure the architecture.
- **Rules**:
  - Not git actions, only technical steps.
  - No code generation, only setup instructions.
  - No assumptions, no "not needed" steps.
  - concentrate exclusively on the feature to be implemented, eg: do not mention naming conventions or code style.
  - Follow only the precise instructions and never install additional libraries unless explicitly requested.
  - Do not give code or commands to execute (e.g., `mkdir ...`); instead, say ‚Äúcreate the new files/folders xxx.‚Äù
- **Actions**:
  - **Configuration Tasks**: External dependency setup, token generation, key management, environment variables.
  - **Technical Setup**: Initializing the project, installing dependencies, creating files/folders.
  - Ensure each step is concise, bullet-pointed, and verified for successful compilation or runtime.
- **Output**:
  - A validated, step-by-step action plan.
  - Be sure everything discussed on "Phase 1" is covered entirely.

**Important**: Do not move to Phase 4 until the user confirms Phase 3.

Before going to phase 4, review the plan to check that good practices are enforced and plan is correct regarding the specifications.

---

### Phase 4: üßë‚Äçüíª Export in Markdown
- **Objective**: Produce a final Markdown document suitable for the ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAI Editor.‚Äù
- **Rules**: 
  - Phase 4 must be answered in markdown format on a text block with 4 backticks.
  - Avoid repetition and focus only on the essentials.
  - No code generation or example but provide instructions on what to do.
  - Provide this phase in english.
- **Actions**:
  - **Sections**:
    1. **Actions for the "developer"**:
      - He should not touch the codebase, only external services that requires configuration.
      - Only **Configuration Tasks** (from Phase 3)
    2. **Actions for the "AI Editor"**:
      - Explain in a short sentence the feature and summarize what do we want to code.
      - Is doing most of the work, it codes everything and change architecture if needed.
      - **Architecture** (from Phase 2): folder structure, components, environment variables etc.
      - **Technical Setup Instructions** (from Phase 3).
      - Give the instructions being very clear but concise, do not be very detailed, just the necessary.
      - **Output in english language.**
      - Add these custom instructions at the end of the document:
        - Never install additional libraries
        - Strictly follow the provided instructions
        - Follow plan in order, no skipping steps
        - Always adapt to current project rules and structure
        - Do all steps without asking
        - Always start with package installation if necessary
        - Use proper versions from package manager
        - Respect conventions, like naming and existing code patterns
  - **Formatting**:
    - Keep instructions concise, accurate, and actionable.
    - Use numbered bullet points to list steps.
  - **No examples**‚Äîstrictly provide mandatory instructions.

**Important**: Conclude only after Phase 4 is validated.

---

## **Instructions**
1. **Start by outlining these four phases** to the user, confirming they understand the process.
2. **Phase-by-phase approach**:
   - Always request and validate user input for each phase before proceeding.
   - **Never skip or combine phases**.
3. **Never generate code**‚Äîyou are the Architect, not the code generator.
4. The final **Markdown document** must be separated into the sections listed under Phase 4.

---

## **Expected Final Output**
When all phases are complete, you will produce a **Markdown document** containing:

1. **Guide for the Developer**:
   - Validated specifications and project goals.
   - Configuration tasks (external dependencies, tokens, etc.).
2. **Guide for the AI Editor**:
   - A strictly defined technical plan and instructions (folder structure, environment variables, setup steps).

## üöÄ Code Generation

### Prompt to generate code instructions `:codeInstructions`

```text
Goal:
<goal>
[[What you want to achieve with this prompt]]
</goal>

Context:  
You (the Architect) have already gathered all user requirements and must produce a single, detailed plan for the Editor.
This plan explains exactly which code to generate or modify (for instance, to create a VS Code extension, add a new feature, or fix a bug).
The Developer (human) will copy/paste these instructions into the Editor‚Äôs prompt.

Roles:  
- Architect (IA): Generates the technical plan only (no code).  
- Editor (IA): Implements the plan by generating or modifying code.  
- Developer (human): Validates the plan and coordinates both IAs.

What to Include:  
- Detailed breakdown of each file, folder, or feature required.  
- Exact file/folder names, function or class stubs, relevant data structures, placeholders for environment variables.  
- Step-by-step explanations so the Editor knows precisely what to create or modify.  
- Markdown formatting with quadruple backticks (````) for clarity‚Äîno code, just instructions.

Prompt for the Architect (write a "technical plan" only, no code):
1. Greet the user, english only, acknowledging all requirements have been finalized. No further specification gathering is needed.  
2. Immediately produce a step-by-step plan describing what code the Editor must generate or modify:  
   - Outline file names and folder structure.  
   - Explain the purpose of each file or component.  
   - Indicate which lines or blocks of code to add or modify (in a generalized, descriptive way).  
   - Highlight any dependencies or environment variables.  
   - Provide instructions for building or testing if applicable.  
3. Output the entire plan in a single Markdown block surrounded by quadruple backticks (````).  
4. Conclude by reminding the Developer to validate the instructions before passing them on to the Editor.
```

### Generate new function from specifications `:codeGenFn`

```text
Goal:

```text
Goal:
Create a new file based on an existing file.

Rules:
- Create a new file with the same structure as the existing file.
- Adapt the code to the new file.
- Do not keep existing logic, only take structure and reusable code.

Context:
<context>
[[Describe new logic]]
</context>

Existing file: #file
New file: #file
```

### Create new generic file `:codeNewFileGeneric`

```text
Goal:
I want to make this file generic so it can "[[purpose]]".

```

## üèûÔ∏è Generate code from image

### Extract details from image and match components (WIP)

```text
Goal:
Extract details from image and match components in the codebase.

Steps:
1. Analyze the image, then extract information about the image.
  - Then, match the information with the components in the codebase.
  - Match every info with a component in the codebase in a bullet point list.
2. Identify: simple text, changing state and actions that must be handled by functions.
  - If you are not sure about what you identified, ask me the relevant questions.
  - Then, continue with the next step.
3. Bind actions from the image with existing functions in the codebase.
  - Use feature folder.
4. Generate code from the information extracted.
  - Extract positions and sizes for each UI elements in the image (padding, margin, alignment, font size, etc.)

```

## üíâ Bug Fixing

### Find the issue `:bugFind`

```text
Goal:
Find the issue in the given code context.

Given: "[[State]]".
When: "[[Action]]".
Then: "[[Expected result]]".

Instead, I get the following:
<error>
[[Result, behavior, error logs... or your analysis]]
</error>

Rules:
- Analyze the given code
- Then list potentials issues and steps to fix the code
- Sort them by relevance
- Issues might be induced by another part of the code, so you might need to check the whole codebase.
```

## üêõ Debugging

### Write log `:debugLog`

```text
Goal:
Add logging messages to the given code at each significant step.

Rules:
- Use an appropriate emoji at the start of each log message for better visualization.
- Annotate the code by adding logging messages at each significant step, including within inner functions.
- Each log message must use a suitable emoji representing the step it corresponds to‚Äî for instance:
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Action Step** (When a particular action is being performed)
  - ‚úÖ **Confirmation Step** (Verifying or completing an action)
  - üîÑ **Calling Function** (Log inner function calls)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Handling Errors** (If logging at the point of error handling)
- Each message must be descriptive to help in easy debugging of errors.
- Ensure loggings are descriptive enough to aid in debugging but not too verbose as to overwhelm output.
- Log points should include function calls, iteration starts, important decisions, error handling, and final steps.
- The focus should be on enhancing clarity without compromising code functionality.
```

### Detect inconsistencies `:debugInconsistency`

```text
Goal:
Review the given code and identify all inconsistencies. 

Check for inconsistencies in:
- Variable names (naming conventions, typos, inconsistencies)
- Function names (naming conventions, clarity, typos)
- General code logic inconsistencies (ensure the code functions as intended)
  
Only point out areas where issues exist. Do not provide commentary on parts of the code that are correct.

Rules:
- Ensure that the suggested solutions conform to the original context and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- Address conflicting logic or discrepancies that might hinder the intended output of the program.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in suggestions; stick with simple and effective solutions that enhance consistency.
- If similar inconsistencies occur repeatedly, note that they need to be corrected throughout the code.
```

## üß™ Tests

### Generate Gherkin `:testGenGherkin`

````text
Goal:
Interpret the following feature description to create a Gherkin-style user story.

Rules:
- Read the feature description: "[[As... I want... So that...]]"
- Based on this requirement, identify the key feature, the primary actions a user with a specific role would take, and the goals or outcomes expected from these actions.
- Structure this information into a detailed Gherkin scenario using the Given-When-Then format.
  - The 'Given' step should establish the context, including the user's role.
  - The 'When' step should describe the user's actions.
  - The 'Then' step should specify the expected outcomes.

Example output:
````gherkin
# Gherkin Best Practices
# ---------------------
# 1. Use ubiquitous language
# 2. One scenario = one test objective
# 3. Avoid technical details in scenarios
# 4. Favor Scenario Outlines for similar tests
# 5. Keep scenarios short and concise (3-5 steps maximum)
# 6. Use tags consistently
# 7. Avoid dependencies between scenarios
# 8. Name your scenarios descriptively
# 9. Use Background for common steps
# 10. Follow Given-When-Then format

# language: en

@tag @multiple_tags
Feature: Feature name
  As a [role]
  I want [action]
  In order to [benefit/value]

  Background:
    Given [prerequisite 1]
    And [prerequisite 2]

  Scenario Outline: [parameterized scenario name]
    Given <param1>
    When <param2>

For the first answer, shortly explain in 1 sentence to the user what we are doing here.

Then, give them bullet points of the markdown template (with only the heading 1) to explain what we are going to fill.

Finally, start to dialog with the user. The aim is to fill the template during that discussion.

Your objective is to help the user build a thorough, well-organized project specification document through guided interaction. 

Follow these steps:
1. Get data from the user, filling in sections of the template where it fits best.
2. Organize user input, even if it‚Äôs provided out of order, to keep the document structured.
3. Ask clarifying questions to ensure all responses are complete and relevant.
4. Challenge answers when needed to refine details and improve quality.
5. Before moving to the next section, verify with the user that they‚Äôre ready to proceed. 
6. Let the user know if any part of the template is incomplete, and ask if they‚Äôd like to fill in missing sections.
7. After each section, offer a summary of what's been added and ask if they‚Äôd like to see it.

To begin, ask the user: "Tell me about your project."
```

#### Continue to fill the document `:pmSpecsContinue`

Once you start chatting, you can continue the discussion to better fill the specification document.

```text
Perfect!

Now, I want you to go through the template I gave you because we need to fill it together.

1. **Template Structure**:
   - The template is formatted in Markdown. It contains main sections with titles in the format `# Title` and subsections as `## Subtitle`.
   - Each subsection includes text and a placeholder surrounded by brackets. Acknowledge this structure, but do not inform the user about it (this is not needed for them).

2. **Prompting User for Input**:
   - For each subsection, ask the user to fill it in. Provide three brief bullet points to guide their response.

3. **User Confirmation**:
   - After the user provides an answer, ask:
     * "Do you want to continue?"
     * "Is there anything else you want to add?"

4. **Handling Edits**:
   - If the user chooses to edit their answer, repeat this step and save the updated response in the template until they confirm they want to continue.

5. **Reviewing Answers**:
   - If the answer is clear and suitable, proceed to the next subsection.
   - If the answer seems unclear or incorrect, notify the user. Don‚Äôt hesitate to assist in refining the answer if necessary for quality.

6. **Transitioning Sections**:
   - When you reach the last subsection, inform the user that you‚Äôll move to the next subtitle (##) and begin asking questions to fill it out.
   - If the next title is a main section (`# Title`), give the user the option to:
     * Jump to the next section
     * Continue editing

7. **Displaying Completed Sections**:
   - If the user wants to jump to the next section, fully display the completed portion of the template.
```

### Selection

#### Choose a tech stack `:pmSelectionTech`

Choose the right tech is hard, an AI can help you find the best tech stack for your project, sorting advantages and drawbacks.

```text
Regarding the technology project I am planning and specifying, I need guidance on selecting the right tools and frameworks.
I have a team of developers (which may consist of just one developer) ready to work on this, and they are open to learning new technologies if needed.
Please base your answers on the template we filled out together.

Here are the key aspects of my project and requirements:

1. Overview of Developer Skills (please review the developers' expertise based on their web resumes):

[[Please provide URLs to the developers' resumes for reference.]]

2. Project Needs: I'm considering various technologies for different aspects of the project, though not all may be necessary. The needs will depend on the chosen tools. For example, if I am using Next.js with Vercel, a separate database might not be required.
My tech stack could include:
   - Frontend frameworks.
   - Frontend UI libraries or frameworks (must be compatible with the chosen frontend framework).
   - Browser extension guidelines (optional depending on specifications).
   - Backend (optional depending on specifications).
   - User authentication systems.
   - Database (optional depending on specifications).
   - Web hosting with email service (optional depending on specifications).
   - Version control platform with Continuous Integration (CI).
   - Containerization (optional depending on specifications).

Please assess the necessity of each component based on my project requirements.

3. Selection Criteria:
   - My project requirements from the template we filled out together.
   - Performance: The solutions should be fast and efficient.
   - Ease of Use: User-friendly and quick to implement.
   - Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable options are preferred.
   - Integration: Technologies should work well together.
   - Community Support: Select technologies with strong community backing and ongoing updates. Avoid tools that are not actively maintained (e.g., Express.js, which is popular but no longer backed).
   - Time to Market: Focus on a rapid launch for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Based on these criteria and the developers' expertise, what technology stack would you recommend for each requirement? (If more than one tool is necessary, please specify.)

Please format your answer like this (surrounded by "---" delimiters):
---
Project Needs:
- Recommended Technology.
- Rationale.
- Required for this project based on the template (y/n with brief explanation).
- Alternative Option.
---

Afterward, please justify your choices in relation to my project requirements.
