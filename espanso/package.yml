      # Gherkin Best Practices
      # ---------------------
      # 1. Use ubiquitous language
      # 2. One scenario = one test objective
      # 3. Avoid technical details in scenarios
      # 4. Favor Scenario Outlines for similar tests
      # 5. Keep scenarios short and concise (3-5 steps maximum)
      # 6. Use tags consistently
      # 7. Avoid dependencies between scenarios
      # 8. Name your scenarios descriptively
      # 9. Use Background for common steps
      # 10. Follow Given-When-Then format

      For the first answer, shortly explain in 1 sentence to the user what we are doing here.

      Then, give them bullet points of the markdown template (with only the heading 1) to explain what we are going to fill.

      Finally, start to dialog with the user. The aim is to fill the template during that discussion.

      Your objective is to help the user build a thorough, well-organized project specification document through guided interaction. 

      Follow these steps:
      1. Get data from the user, filling in sections of the template where it fits best.
      2. Organize user input, even if it’s provided out of order, to keep the document structured.
      3. Ask clarifying questions to ensure all responses are complete and relevant.
      4. Challenge answers when needed to refine details and improve quality.
      5. Before moving to the next section, verify with the user that they’re ready to proceed. 
      6. Let the user know if any part of the template is incomplete, and ask if they’d like to fill in missing sections.
      7. After each section, offer a summary of what's been added and ask if they’d like to see it.

      To begin, ask the user: "Tell me about your project."

      Perfect!

      Now, I want you to go through the template I gave you because we need to fill it together.

      1. **Template Structure**:
         - The template is formatted in Markdown. It contains main sections with titles in the format `# Title` and subsections as `## Subtitle`.
         - Each subsection includes text and a placeholder surrounded by brackets. Acknowledge this structure, but do not inform the user about it (this is not needed for them).

      2. **Prompting User for Input**:
         - For each subsection, ask the user to fill it in. Provide three brief bullet points to guide their response.

      3. **User Confirmation**:
         - After the user provides an answer, ask:
           * "Do you want to continue?"
           * "Is there anything else you want to add?"

      4. **Handling Edits**:
         - If the user chooses to edit their answer, repeat this step and save the updated response in the template until they confirm they want to continue.

      5. **Reviewing Answers**:
         - If the answer is clear and suitable, proceed to the next subsection.
         - If the answer seems unclear or incorrect, notify the user. Don’t hesitate to assist in refining the answer if necessary for quality.

      6. **Transitioning Sections**:
         - When you reach the last subsection, inform the user that you’ll move to the next subtitle (##) and begin asking questions to fill it out.
         - If the next title is a main section (`# Title`), give the user the option to:
           * Jump to the next section
           * Continue editing

      7. **Displaying Completed Sections**:
         - If the user wants to jump to the next section, fully display the completed portion of the template.

      Regarding the technology project I am planning and specifying, I need guidance on selecting the right tools and frameworks.
      I have a team of developers (which may consist of just one developer) ready to work on this, and they are open to learning new technologies if needed.
      Please base your answers on the template we filled out together.

      Here are the key aspects of my project and requirements:

      1. Overview of Developer Skills (please review the developers' expertise based on their web resumes):

      [[please_provide_urls_to_the_developers_resumes_for_reference]]

      2. Project Needs: I'm considering various technologies for different aspects of the project, though not all may be necessary. The needs will depend on the chosen tools. For example, if I am using Next.js with Vercel, a separate database might not be required.
      My tech stack could include:
         - Frontend frameworks.
         - Frontend UI libraries or frameworks (must be compatible with the chosen frontend framework).
         - Browser extension guidelines (optional depending on specifications).
         - Backend (optional depending on specifications).
         - User authentication systems.
         - Database (optional depending on specifications).
         - Web hosting with email service (optional depending on specifications).
         - Version control platform with Continuous Integration (CI).
         - Containerization (optional depending on specifications).

      Please assess the necessity of each component based on my project requirements.

      3. Selection Criteria:
         - My project requirements from the template we filled out together.
         - Performance: The solutions should be fast and efficient.
         - Ease of Use: User-friendly and quick to implement.
         - Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable options are preferred.
         - Integration: Technologies should work well together.
         - Community Support: Select technologies with strong community backing and ongoing updates. Avoid tools that are not actively maintained (e.g., Express.js, which is popular but no longer backed).
         - Time to Market: Focus on a rapid launch for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

      Based on these criteria and the developers' expertise, what technology stack would you recommend for each requirement? (If more than one tool is necessary, please specify.)

      Please format your answer like this (surrounded by "---" delimiters):
      ---
      Project Needs:
      - Recommended Technology.
      - Rationale.
      - Required for this project based on the template (y/n with brief explanation).
      - Alternative Option.
      ---

      Afterward, please justify your choices in relation to my project requirements.

      Based on these specifications, I need user stories for the developer to follow when implementing the code.

      Using our wireframes and documentation, please generate a comprehensive list of user stories for this project.

      For each milestone we define, create a set of user stories that will capture all essential details.

      Please interpret the following feature description to create a Gherkin-style user story.

      The description is: "[[as_i_want_so_that]]"

      - Based on this description, identify the key feature, the primary actions a user with a specific role would take, and the goals or outcomes expected from these actions.
      - Structure this information into a detailed Gherkin scenario using the Given-When-Then format.
        - The 'Given' step should establish the context, including the user's role.
        - The 'When' step should describe the user's actions.
        - The 'Then' step should specify the expected outcomes.

      - Keep only the feature scope and focus only on the sub-steps, do not think about side tasks or parent ones.
      - Add a simple test feature list explanation with checkboxes as well.
      - Do not hesitate to add notes regarding important aspect of what you wrote.
